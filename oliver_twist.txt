"there were faces that the grave had changed and closed upon, but which the mind, superior to its power, still dressed in their old freshness and beauty, calling back the lustre of the eyes, the brightness of the smile, the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay, and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb, changed but to be heightened and taken from earth only to be set up as a light, to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to Heaven."

p.103 - The old gentleman (Mr Brownlow) who accussed Oliver of stealing his pocket handkerkerchief muses on the familiarity of Oliver's face.


"Alas! How few of Nature's faces are left alone to gladden us with their beauty! The cares, and sorrows, and hungerings of the world, change them as they change hearts; and it is only when those passions sleep, and have lost their hold for ever that the troubled clouds pass off, and leave Heaven's surface clear. It is a common thing for the countenances of the dead, even in that fixed and rigid state, to subside into the long-forgotten expression of sleeping infancy and settle into the very look of early life; so calm, so peaceful, do they grow again that those who knew them in their happy childhood, kneel by the coffin's side in awe, and see the Angel even upon earth"

p. 216 - A remark paragraph after describing the ugly and disfigured face of the old woman who comes to Mrs Corney to bring her to the deathbed of a soon-to-expire woman.
