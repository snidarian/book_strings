"there were faces that the grave had changed and closed upon, but which the mind, superior to its power, still dressed in their old freshness and beauty, calling back the lustre of the eyes, the brightness of the smile, the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay, and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb, changed but to be heightened and taken from earth only to be set up as a light, to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to Heaven."

p.103 - The old gentleman (Mr Brownlow) who accussed Oliver of stealing his pocket handkerkerchief muses on the familiarity of Oliver's face.

-------------------------------------------------------

"Alas! How few of Nature's faces are left alone to gladden us with their beauty! The cares, and sorrows, and hungerings of the world, change them as they change hearts; and it is only when those passions sleep, and have lost their hold for ever that the troubled clouds pass off, and leave Heaven's surface clear. It is a common thing for the countenances of the dead, even in that fixed and rigid state, to subside into the long-forgotten expression of sleeping infancy and settle into the very look of early life; so calm, so peaceful, do they grow again that those who knew them in their happy childhood, kneel by the coffin's side in awe, and see the Angel even upon earth"

p. 216 - A remark paragraph after describing the ugly and disfigured face of the old woman who comes to Mrs Corney to bring her to the deathbed of a soon-to-expire woman.

"Oh! if when we oppress and grind our fellow-creatures, we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of human error, which, like dense and heavy clouds, are rising, slowly it is true, but not less surely, to Heaven, to pour their after-vengeance on our heads--if we heard but one instant, in imagination, the deep testimony of dead men's voices, which no power can stifle, and no pride shut out-- where would be the unjury and injustice, the suffering, misery, cruelty, and wrong that each day's life brings with it!"

p. 266 - A moral flourish by dickens shortly after Oliver awakes as a patient in the house he was made to help rob the night before.

It is a world of disappointment, often to the hopes we most cherish, and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour. Poor Dick was dead!

p. 467 - What is said after oliver learns that his old friend Dick, of which was so kind to him, is now dead.
