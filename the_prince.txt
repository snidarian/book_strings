Niccolo Machiaveli's "The Prince"


"And there is nothing that wears out faster than generosity; even as you practice it, you lose the means of practicing it, and you become poor andcontemptible or (in the course of escaping poverty) rapacious and hateful. The thing above all against which a prince must protect himself is being contemptible and hateful; generosity leads to both. Thus, it's much wiser to put up with the reputation of being a miser, which brings you shame without hate, than to be forced - just because you want to appear generous - into a reputation for rapacity, which brings shame on you and hate along with it."

p. 47, Chapter 16
